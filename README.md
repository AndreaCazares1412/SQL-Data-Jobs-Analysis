# Background
Driven by curiosity, portfolio building, and a desire to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was built to practice real-world SQL skills while uncovering valuable career insights. As part of the [SQL for Data Analytics by Luke Barousse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA), and wanted to apply what I learned in a meaningful way.

Using job posting data, I set out to answer five key questions:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?  

The result? A practical SQL project aimed at helping aspiring analysts (myself included) make smarter skill-building decisions.

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

* **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.  
* **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.  
* **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.  
* **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.  

# The Anlaysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
  job_id, 
  job_title,
  job_location, 
  job_schedule_type, 
  salary_year_avg, 
  job_posted_date::DATE,
  c.name AS company
FROM job_postings_fact AS jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c ON  jpf.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE 
  job_work_from_home = True AND
  job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
 ```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:

* Wide Salary Range: Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
* Diverse Employers: Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
* Job Title Variety: There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_ten_highest_paying AS (
    SELECT 
    job_id, 
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg, 
    c.name AS company
FROM job_postings_fact AS jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c ON  jpf.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE 
    job_work_from_home = True AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_ten_highest_paying.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_ten_highest_paying
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_ten_highest_paying.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
