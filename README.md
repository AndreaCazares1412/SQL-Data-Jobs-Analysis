# Background
Fueled by a desire to explore the data analyst job market and extract actionable insights, I chose SQL as the core tool for this analysis because of its power to handle large datasets efficiently, uncover trends through flexible querying, and support clean, scalable data exploration. This project allowed me to apply SQL not just as a technical skill, but as a method for answering meaningful questions‚Äîturning raw job data into strategic career insights.

Using job posting data, I set out to answer five key questions:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. Which skills are most optimal to learn (value = salary √ó demand)?

The result? A practical SQL project aimed at helping aspiring analysts (myself included) make smarter skill-building decisions.

  job_posted_date::DATE,
  c.name AS company
FROM job_postings_fact AS jpf
LEFT JOIN company_dim AS c ON  jpf.company_id = c.company_id
WHERE 
  job_work_from_home = True AND
  job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
  salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND 
  job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
 ```

### 5. Most Optimal Skills to Learn
This query aims to identify the most optimal skills to learn as a data analyst by combining two key factors:

* üî• Skill Demand: how frequently a skill appears in job postings

* üí∞ Average Salary: how well-paying the jobs are where the skill appears

To avoid favoring just highly common or just highly paid skills, I calculate a balanced score using the formula:

```sql
score = salary_avg * LOG(skill_demand)
```
* Why LOG()?: Using LOG(skill_demand) reduces the over-influence of very frequent skills (like SQL), while still giving credit to skills with real market demand.

### What the query does:
* Joins job postings with associated skills
* Filters for data analyst jobs with non-null salaries
* Aggregates the average salary and skill frequency
* Calculates a score to rank skills based on both value and demand
* Returns the top 10 skills with the highest score



```sql
WITH highest_payed_skill AS (
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_dim.skills) AS skill_demand,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS salary_avg
FROM skills_job_dim
LEFT JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
LEFT JOIN job_postings_fact ON skills_job_dim.job_id = job_postings_fact.job_id
WHERE 
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
    AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
GROUP BY skills_dim.skills,  skills_dim.skill_id)


SELECT highest_payed_skill.*,
    ROUND(highest_payed_skill.salary_avg * LOG(highest_payed_skill.skill_demand)) AS score
FROM highest_payed_skill 
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

| Rank | Skill     | Demand | Avg Salary ($) | Score   |
|------|-----------|--------|----------------|---------|
| 1    | SQL       | 3,083  | 96,435         | 336,459 |
| 2    | Python    | 1,840  | 101,512        | 331,418 |
| 3    | Tableau   | 1,659  | 97,978         | 315,474 |
| 4    | R         | 1,073  | 98,708         | 299,144 |
| 5    | Excel     | 2,143  | 86,419         | 287,864 |
| 6    | Power BI  | 1,044  | 92,324         | 278,699 |
| 7    | Snowflake |   241  | 111,578        | 265,781 |
| 8    | Azure     |   319  | 105,400        | 263,900 |
| 9    | AWS       |   291  | 106,440        | 262,257 |
| 10   | Spark     |   187  | 113,002        | 256,723 |
